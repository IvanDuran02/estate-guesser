## About me - Estate Guesser

This is a personal project I decided to make after thinking it would be quite fun to make a geoguesser like game but for housing prices.
I also made an API that grabs property data for use in this website although I have to transfer it to postgres from sqlite and haven't got around to it.
as of now there are only 3 houses I manually copied over from my development database.
